# LifeOS for Teens

**School teaches subjects. We teach life.**

LifeOS for Teens is a gamified web platform that helps teenagers (13–19) learn real-world skills like communication, discipline, money management and decision-making through short interactive challenges instead of long courses.

The experience works like Duolingo — but for life skills.
